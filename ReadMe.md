# Learning MongoDB

## The [MongoDB Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/) is one of the best resource I have ever encounterd to learn MongoDB.

## MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. No database is more productive to use.

MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents.<br> 
Rich JSON Documents:
- The most natural and productive way to work with data.
- Supports arrays and nested objects as values.
- Allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.<br>
<br>

Powerful query language:<br>
- Rich and expressive query language that allows you to filter and sort by any field, no matter how nested it may be within a document.
- Support for aggregations and other modern use-cases such as geo-based search, graph search, and text search.
- Queries are themselves JSON, and thus easily composable. No more concatenating strings to dynamically generate SQL queries.

### Suggestion and feedback are always welcome, feel free to fork and make changes.
